Relational database organizes data into one or more tables
Each table has columns and rows
A unique key identifies each rows

Non relational database
Not a traditional table. Can have key-value stores, documents, graphs, flexible tables

Need RDBMS

A foreign key is the primary key of another table
A composite key needs 2 attributes. Only together can they uniquely identify the table
